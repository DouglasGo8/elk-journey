== Install Guide with Docker compose

* As the Elastic Stack has grown over the years and the feature sets have increased, so has the complexity of getting started or attempting a proof-of-concept (POC) locally, while Elastic Cloud is still the fastest and easiest way to get started with Elastic, the need for local development and testing is still widely abundant, we’ll dive into configuring the components of a standard Elastic Stack consisting of Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats (ELK-B), on which we can immediately begin developing, Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Logstash will all need additional configuration from yml files. see docker-compose.yml file

The setup container will start up first, wait for the ES01 container to come online, all the certificates to the “certs” volume so that all other containers can have access to them

. Is an _Open Source_ processing engine responsible for receiving processing and shipping events, we can manipulate the data, cleaning or enriching data
